# BOJ
- my own solutions to BOJ problems
## rules
- link to the problem must be mentioned due to the [copyright issue](https://www.acmicpc.net/board/view/2185)
- Name of the file must start with problem number with 6 digits.
- The codes in this directory must be the most efficient(simple, fast) code for the problem among the codes that I implemented. The code with poor performance(about the same problem) will be stored at 'poor_version' directory.
- When git is cloned, you must manually create 'executable' directory
- compile.sh will compile c++ files(.cpp) to 'executable' directory
- fce.sh will find the question that matches question number, compile it, execute it.
  - usage example:(you have to type question number when asked)
  ```console
  foo@bar:~/implementation_of_algorithms/BOJ$ ./fce.sh
  question number: 001008
  compile finished. Now executing 001008_A_divided_by_B
  1 3
  0.33333333333333331
  ```
- clear.sh will remove compiled executable binary files(at 'executable' directory) and temporary files(file name ends with '~')
- solutions provided by others with better performance is placed at 'others_better_solution' directory
