# CSES
- my own solutions to CSES problems
## Rules
- link to the problems will be mentioned
- Name of the file must start with problem number with 6 digits.
- The codes in the 'code' directory must be the most efficient(simple, fast) code for the problem among the codes that I implemented. The code with poor performance(about the same problem) will be stored at 'poor_version' directory.
- When git is cloned, you must manually create 'executable' directory
- compile.sh will compile c++ files(.cpp) to 'executable' directory
- fce.sh will find the question that matches question number, compile it, execute it.
  - usage example:(you have to type question number)
  ```console
  foo@bar:~/implementation_of_algorithms/CSES/code$ ./fce.sh 001008
  compile finished. Now executing 001008_A_divided_by_B
  1 3
  0.33333333333333331
  ```
- clear.sh will remove compiled executable binary files(at 'executable' directory) and temporary files(file name ends with '~')
- gac.sh will add and commit to git repository(but not push). You will be asked to type the name for commit.
- solutions provided by others with better performance is placed at 'others_better_solution' directory
